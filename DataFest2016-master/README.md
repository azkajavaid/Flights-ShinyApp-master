We wanted to predict how mobile users can be differentiated from non mobile ticket buyers as a means of optimizing ticket sales. 
We used machine learning classification approach to assess if the type of user (mobile vs. non mobile) can be predicted by 
the quantity of tickets purchased, cost per ticket and whether or not the ticket was printed (as opposed to e-reserve). Our model resulted
in about 88% accuracy. We also performed an equivalent generalized linear model (GLM) logistic regression model to validate these results.
We found that in general, higher cost per ticket, higher quantity of tickets purchased and if the ticket was not printed are all 
patterns that correlate with a mobile user (See attached FinalPresentation and FinalCode for a quick overview of further topics explored).
